      I'm currently completing my Bachelor's in Computer Science from Bits Pilani Goa. All my life I have spent with my family at home or friends at college. I realized that after graduating I would have to learn a lot of things about how this world works. So I decided to create this blog to share with you some of the things that I might have learned.
